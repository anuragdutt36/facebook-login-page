# facebook-login-page
Built Facebook login page using Tailwind, and learned so many things from here.
If you want to serve my webpage you have to download node_modules, Here is the following steps..

1. Open my file in your code editor and write "npm i" in editor's terminal.
2. After downloading the node file you have to write a commond which is "npm run start".
3. You get a local server in your terminal, now click and serve my webpage.

Thank You!
